# Subscribify-Events-Laravel

A Laravel-based project implementing core subscription management and role-based access control, built using the Factory Pattern.

## üèó Completed Features

- **Roles & Authentication**  
  Implemented user roles and authentication logic via the Factory Pattern.

- **Subscription Management**  
  Subscription features developed using the Factory Pattern for modular extensibility.

## ‚è≥ Incomplete Features

- **Test Coverage (TDD)**  
  Initial TDD approach was planned, but deferred due to time constraints. Test cases and coverage are pending.

- **User Interface Improvements**  
  UI currently uses Laravel Breeze‚Äôs default scaffolding. UI/UX refinement, styling, and layout improvements are needed.

- **Additional Features**  
  Depending on project scope, may include: custom admin dashboard, subscription billing, Ticketing, email notifications, improved error handling, etc.

##  Tech Stack
